# Lab: Make an app with the Brewdog API

## Learning Objectives
- Practice making requests and displaying the data in the page
- Practice traversing the data structure received from an API
- Practice using Vue's lifecycle hooks and binding directive.

Your task is to build an app that uses [this API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) to display information on a variety of beers.

[This endpoint](https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers) will provide you with some data detailing multiple beers.

## MVP

Your app should be able to:
- Allow the user to display information about a selected beer (at least a beer's image, name and description).
- Allow users to add their favourite beers to a list that is also displayed in your app.
- Add functionality for users to remove beers from their favourites list.

## Extensions

- Display a beer's ingredients.
- Ensure that users cannot add the same beer to the favourites list multiple times.
